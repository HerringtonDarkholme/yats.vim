Yet Another TypeScript Syntax file for Vim, adapted from [YAJS](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim).
Key differences:

* Exuberant Highlighting. The most elaborate or byzatine syntax highlighting for TypeScript.
* Bundled with snippets for UltiSnips!
* Builtin Support for tagbar!
* Use 'typescript' as group name's prefix, not 'typeScript' nor 'TypeScript'. Works great with [SyntaxComplete](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SyntaxComplete).
* Inherit Web API and DOM keywords from YAJS
* Syntax fold. Fold long code block, semantically!
* Remove old, unused syntax definitions.
